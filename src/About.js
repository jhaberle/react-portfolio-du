        Hi there, my name is Jake Haberle. I am 35 years old and I grew up in
        Parker, Colorado. I have a beautiful wife, Heather, along with two boys
        Josh (4),and Dylan (2). Being a dad is awesome, challenging and by far
        the coolest thing I've ever done. If I ever have free time I love
        hitting the slopes, playing some golf, and watching all of the Denver
        spots teams.
        <br />
        <br />I currently work at Empower Retirement in Investment Operations as
        a Valuations Analyst. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to learn a
        new skillset, which will hopefully create new opportunites in the
        future.
